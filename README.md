These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) Puzzles.

Currently, there are only solutions to 2023 and 2024. I also participated in 2022 and 2021, but I cannot find the code for either of these years (it's on my old laptop somewhere...).

## Stars :star:

- 2023 - 46
- 2022 - 39
- 2021 - 22

## Notes :pencil2:

- If you want to use these solutions on your own input, save it in a text file called `day[n].txt` where `[n]` is the day number.
- Maybe one year I'll try to get on the leaderboard for just one day...
