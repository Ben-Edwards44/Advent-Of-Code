These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) Puzzles.

Currently, only the solutions to the 2023 puzzles are here but I fully intend to continue doing the future years.
I also participated in 2022 and 2021, but I cannot find the code for either of these years.

The solutions are often not at all optimised or readable, they are just what I came up with each day. Some of the programs (*like [2023 day 17](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/17)*)

## Stars :star:

- 2023 - 46
- 2022 - 39
- 2021 - 22

## Useage :wrench:

If you want to run these solutions on your own input:

- *Don't.* There are much better solutions to use such as [this repository](https://github.com/hyper-neutrino/advent-of-code) by hyper-neutrino.
- If you still want to:
  - Copy your input into a file named `day{n}.txt` and replace `{n}` with the day number.
  - Save this file in the same directory as the python script.
  - Ensure there is a newline at the end of the file.
  - Run the appropriate python script.
